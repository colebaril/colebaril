Data Analyst | R Programmer | Laboratory Scientist | Insect Enthusiast
I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions for data analysis, automation, and visualization. With a background in microbiology, mosquito-borne viruses, HIV-1 quality management, and bioinformatics, Iâ€™ve developed dynamic Shiny dashboards, automated workflows, and built custom analytical pipelines. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in entomology, particularly mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects. My expertise spans across R, ggplot, VBA, and bioinformatics, with a focus on turning complex data into actionable insights. Whether itâ€™s optimizing lab processes, analyzing insect populations, or developing interactive plots with ggiraph, Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to innovate and streamline processes.
