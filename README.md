ðŸ“ˆ Data Analyst | ðŸ’» R Programmer | ðŸ”¬ Laboratory Scientist | ðŸ¦Ÿ Entomologist

Hello, I'm Cole Baril. I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions for data analysis, automation, and visualization. With a background in microbiology, mosquito-borne viruses, entomology, HIV-1 quality management, and bioinformatics, Iâ€™ve developed dynamic Shiny dashboards, automated workflows, and built custom analytical pipelines. I have spearheaded mosquito-borne virus surveillance projects and population dynamics studies in the Canadian Prairies. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in entomology, particularly mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects of concern to public health and food security. My expertise spans across R, ggplot, and bioinformatics, with a focus on turning complex data into actionable insights. Whether itâ€™s optimizing lab processes, analyzing insect populations or microbiomes, or developing interactive plots with ggiraph, Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to innovate and streamline processes.
