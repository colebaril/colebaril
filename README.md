ðŸ“ˆ Data Analyst | ðŸ’» R Programmer | ðŸ”¬ Laboratory Scientist | ðŸ¦Ÿ Entomologist

Hello, I'm Cole Baril. With a Masterâ€™s degree in Environmental and Life Sciences, I specialize in the intersection of data analysis and laboratory science, with extensive experience in entomology, microbiology, mosquito-borne viruses, and quality management of sexually transmitted and blood-borne pathogens (HIV-1, HCV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea). Iâ€™ve led projects involving next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and data-driven insights, contributing to research on mosquito and tick pathogens, including the identification of novel viruses. My technical skills include R programming (Tidyverse, Shiny, RMarkdown), statistical modeling, bioinformatics (Bowtie2, CLC Genomics Workbench), and automating workflows to increase efficiency. An enthusiast of all things insects, Iâ€™m passionate about using data to address ecological and public health challenges.
